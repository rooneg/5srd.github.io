These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma'at---the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in the universe.

The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods responsible for death, each with different alignments. [Anubis](/deities/anubis/) is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. [Set](/deities/set/) is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother [Osiris](/deities/osiris/). And [Nephthys](/deities/nephthys/) is a chaotic good goddess of mourning.
