You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
