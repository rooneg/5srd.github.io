You transform up to ten centipedes, three [spiders](/monsters/spider/), five wasps, or one [scorpion](/monsters/scorpion/) within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a [giant centipede](/monsters/centipede-giant/), a spider becomes a [giant spider](/monsters/spider-giant/), a wasp becomes a [giant wasp](/monsters/wasp-giant/), and a scorpion becomes a [giant scorpion](/monsters/scorpion-giant/).

Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.

A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.

The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.
