**Bull's Strength.** The target has advantage on Strength checks, and his or her carrying capacity doubles.

**Cat's Grace.** The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn't take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn't incapacitated.

**Eagle's Splendor.** The target has advantage on Charisma checks.

**Fox's Cunning.** The target has advantage on Intelligence checks.

**Owl's Wisdom.** The target has advantage on Wisdom checks.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
