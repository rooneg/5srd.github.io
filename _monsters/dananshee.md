        The dananshee’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). The dananshee can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

        - At will: [*guidance*](/spells/guidance/), [*minor illusion*](/spells/minor-illusion/)
        - 3/day each: [*charm person*](/spells/charm-person/)
        - 1/day each: [*barkskin*](/spells/barkskin/)
    - name: Speak with Beasts and Plants
      text: The dananshee can communicate with beasts and plants as if they shared a language.
    - name: Tree Stride
      text: Once on her turn, a dananshee can use 10 feet of her movement to step magically into one living tree within her reach and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be Large or bigger.

  - name: Dagger
    text: |
      *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d4+2) piercing damage.
  - name: Enthralling Song
    text: |
      The dananshee sings a magical melody. Every humanoid within 100 feet of the dananshee that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. While charmed in this way, a target is incapacitated and has a speed of 0. Each target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to any dananshee’s enthralling song for 1 hour.

      The dananshee must use a bonus action each round to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the dananshee is incapacitated.

Dananshee are supernaturally beautiful faerie creatures, close kin to [dryads](/monsters/dryad/). They have delicate features, dark skin, and hair of red, gold, or light brown. They appear dressed in very little clothing, and what they do wear is always made of leaves and other natural materials.
