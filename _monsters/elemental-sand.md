Combined elementals are often the result of a summoning gone awry. When [*conjure elemental*](/spells/conjure-elemental/) or a similar spell is cast incorrectly, the magic calls forth two life forces from separate elemental planes. These forces combine into a single, enormous form with power beyond that of a typical elemental, which makes them nearly impossible to control. Only the most powerful spellcasters can keep these beings from committing a hate-fueled destructive rampage.

The power of air and earth create sand elementals. These beings crush other creatures with tremendous weight and tear them apart with rough sand grains.
