        The grim puppeteer lures prey using its web strands to manipulate the bodies of slain creatures as puppets or marionettes, and it can mimic non-verbal human and animal sounds to complete the illusion. A character viewing this display may make a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check to determine that there is something unusual or unnatural about the puppet's movement or sounds.

        Grim puppeteers use corpses in cunning and appropriate ways: a female humanoid's corpse may be used to lure a young male of the same species, or a jungle cat's favorite prey animal may be dangled to get the feline within range of the puppeteer's bite. The grim puppeteer knows instinctively how to best use its puppet to fool a passerby, so an animal corpse might seem lame, an easy target for a hunter or predator; or a humanoid body might seem to moan as if in pain and make vague gestures, or perhaps it might appear to hide furtively behind the puppeteer's tree or rock perch.

      *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 6 (1d6+3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

The grim puppeteer is a large arachnid predator that drains prey of vital fluids, then uses the spent corpse as bait to attract future meals. These corpses are strung up like marionettes with the puppeteer's webs and manipulated to lure passing creatures into range of its bite. The puppeteer then hoists the new carcass up to be dined upon at leisure; if necessary, it tracks prey that wanders off, then drags the limp body back to its web to be devoured.
