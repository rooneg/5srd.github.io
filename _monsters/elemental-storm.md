    text: The elemental can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the elemental or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) lightning and 7 (2d6) thunder damage. In addition, the elemental can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 7 (2d6) lightning and 7 (2d6) thunder damage. Any creature which ends its turn in the same space as the elemental takes 7 (2d6) lightning and 7 (2d6) thunder damage at the end of its turn.

Combined elementals are often the result of a summoning gone awry. When [*conjure elemental*](/spells/conjure-elemental/) or a similar spell is cast incorrectly, the magic calls forth two life forces from separate elemental planes. These forces combine into a single, enormous form with power beyond that of a typical elemental, which makes them nearly impossible to control. Only the most powerful spellcasters can keep these beings from committing a hate-fueled destructive rampage.

Storm elementals combine air and water elemental forces to create typhoons of unimaginable destruction. These raging storms rain savage lightning and fury on all living beings they come across.
