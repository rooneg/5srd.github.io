      *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (6d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and the creature is grappled (escape DC 20). While grappled this way the creature is restrained and cannot breathe. The elemental can grapple one Huge, two Large, or eight Medium or smaller creatures at one time.

    text: *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (3d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage and if the target is a creature it is restrained by the mud. The target can escape the mud and end the restrained condition by using its action to make a DC 19 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

Combined elementals are often the result of a summoning gone awry. When [*conjure elemental*](/spells/conjure-elemental/) or a similar spell is cast incorrectly, the magic calls forth two life forces from separate elemental planes. These forces combine into a single, enormous form with power beyond that of a typical elemental, which makes them nearly impossible to control. Only the most powerful spellcasters can keep these beings from committing a hate-fueled destructive rampage.

Mud elementals are the combined anger of earth and water. They seek to drown all living things in choking sludge.
