    text: The elemental sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light in an additional 60 feet.
  - name: Magma Form
    text: The elemental can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the elemental or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 16 (3d10) fire damage. In addition, the elemental can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature’s space on a turn, that creature takes 16 (3d10) fire damage. The space the elemental occupies is difficult terrain for other creatures. A creature which ends its turn in the same space as the elemental takes 16 (3d10) fire damage.
  - name: Magma Movement
    text: The elemental can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the elemental leaves a fiery tunnel in its wake.

      *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (6d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and 9 (2d8) fire damage and if the target is a creature it is grappled (escape DC 20). A creature grappled in this way is restrained and takes 16 (3d10) fire damage at the end of its turn. This damage does not stack with the end of turn damage from the elemental’s Magma Form. The elemental can grapple one Huge, two Large, or eight Medium or smaller creatures at one time.

      *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* 33 (4d12 + 7) fire damage and if the target is a creature it is restrained by the magma. A creature can escape the magma and end the restrained condition by using its action to make a DC 19 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. A target restrained in this way takes 16 (3d10) fire damage at the end of its turn.

Combined elementals are often the result of a summoning gone awry. When [*conjure elemental*](/spells/conjure-elemental/) or a similar spell is cast incorrectly, the magic calls forth two life forces from separate elemental planes. These forces combine into a single, enormous form with power beyond that of a typical elemental, which makes them nearly impossible to control. Only the most powerful spellcasters can keep these beings from committing a hate-fueled destructive rampage.

Magma elementals are the most powerful combined elementals. Earth and fire bolster one another, creating a massive being bent on covering the world in lava.
