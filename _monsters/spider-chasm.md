      *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

Roughly the size of a large house cat, the chasm spiders of the Chasm of Flies are fearless and very aggressive. They generally attack in numbers, relying on their poison to bring down larger prey or interlopers.
