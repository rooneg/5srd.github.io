Undead hounds are cunning and sadistic hunters. Untiring, they hunt living prey both for pleasure and to feast upon their flesh. Undead hounds are ideal weapons of terror and war, used by necromancers on the unsuspecting as well as in deliberate assaults against enemy forces and the pursuit of fleeing foes.
