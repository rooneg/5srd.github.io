    text: |
      *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d4+2) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 2 (1d4) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
