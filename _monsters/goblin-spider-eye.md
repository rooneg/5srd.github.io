This small humanoid has six long, slender arms ending in wicked claws, along with a bizarre array of eight eyes above its fanged maw. It wears scraps of cloth and bits of polished stone, and it scampers about easily on one of its pairs of arms and its legs.

## Spider-Eye Goblin Lore

Goblinoids were among the titans' first attempts at creating humanoids. They fell somewhat short of being a desirable servitor race and were fast forgotten. Over time, many tribes soaked up aspects of the primordial Scarn, evolving into the varieties of goblinoid races that exist in present times.

The following specific information about spider-eye goblins can be obtained with a successful check, as indicated below.

**Intelligence (Nature) DC 5.** Spider-eye goblins were infused with a monstrous arachnid essence, becoming one of the most hideous branches of an already ugly race. These multi- limbed, multi-eyed goblinoid creatures make their lairs in deep jungle caves or in dark caverns close to the land's surface.

**Intelligence (Nature) DC 15.** Like the common goblins from which they descend, spider-eye goblins breed quickly; like the spiders they resemble, they produce eggs, and in much larger numbers than the broods common to typical goblins. Fortunately, the female often eats the male after mating, as well as many of her own young, which helps to keep their disgusting population in check. As a result, despite their prolific reproductive rates, their numbers in any given tribe are no greater than those of most goblinoids.

**Intelligence (History or Religion) DC 15.** After the titans fell, most spider-eye tribes took to worshiping the goddess Sethris, Demon Witch of the Web.

**Intelligence (History or Religion) DC 25.** However, there is evidence to suggest the spider-eye goblins occupying the region around the Chasm of Flies turned their devotions from Sethris, the Lady of Vengeance, toward the fallen lesser titan known as Spiragos the Ambusher. Or perhaps these goblins have always worshipped Spiragos and simply never turned to the worship of the goddess of Vengeance in the first place. Given their physical similarity to Spiragos, it is possible, though by no means certain, that they were either formed by the titan or twisted into his image.

## Behavior

Spider-eye goblins make their lairs in deep, dark places far enough from divine races that they can't easily be routed, but close enough that they can still send long-range raiding parties from time to time. Their typical ruling structure is a matriarchy, with a female adept or witch most often ruling the group. Any sizable spider-eye goblin tribe keeps giant spiders as guardian beasts if not as trained mounts.

Spider-eye goblins are hostile and ferocious, but not particularly courageous; in an extended fight, or a battle against foes more numerous than themselves, a leaderless gang demonstrates typical goblin cowardice. In defense of their lair, though, they can be quite fearless.

Spider-eye tactics rely on ambush, making use of their natural climbing ability to hide in the tree canopy or on cavern ceilings, where they rain javelins and darts upon their prey. Though not bright, they are cunning with traps.
