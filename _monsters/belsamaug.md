      text: |
        With each sunrise, a belsamaug melds into whatever earth or rock it is standing on, leaving only a Tiny basalt stone to mark the place of its passing. When moonlight again touches the basalt stone, the stone vanishes and the belsamaug rises once again to hunt. This effect cannot be resisted by the belsamaug, and it takes 2 rounds to meld or to rise. During this time, the belsamaug is stunned. This ability otherwise functions as the spell [*meld into stone*](/spells/meld-into-stone/).

        Should a belsamaug's basalt stone ever be destroyed, the belsamaug is killed instantly. The stone has AC 7, 20 hp, immunity to acid, fire, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage, as well as resistance to cold and to piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. It has vulnerability to thunder damage.

When the moon looks down upon Scarn, Belsameth's children roam the night and hunt unwary prey. The belsamaug were once a vicious race of goblinoids, twisted and blessed by their dark goddess; sinister creatures, they emphasize their narrow frames and opal eyes with skintight leather, and often adorn themselves with past victims' knives and daggers, which they usually keep as trophies of their kills.
