You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a [berserker](/npcs/berserker/). They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Four types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly.

|  d100  | Horn Type | Rarity    | Berserkers Summoned | Requirement                          |
|:------:|:----------|:----------|:-------------------:|:-------------------------------------|
| 01--40 | Silver    | Rare      |       2d4 + 2       | None                                 |
| 41--75 | Brass     | Rare      |       3d4 + 3       | Proficiency with all simple weapons  |
| 91--00 | Iron      | Very rare |       5d4 + 5       | Proficiency with all martial weapons |
| 76--90 | Bronze    | Legendary |       4d4 + 4       | Proficiency with all medium armor    |

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.
