This spellbook can contain only five spells of 1st level or higher. When you cast one of those spells with this book in hand, you may change its damage type to lightning or thunder. If the spell normally deals lightning or thunder damage, you may instead resolve the spell as if it had been cast with a spell slot one level higher than the one you used (to a maximum of 9th level). You may use either of these benefits three times per day. These uses refresh at sunrise.

While attuned to this book, you also gain advantage on saving throws against spells and effects dealing lightning or thunder damage.

A wizard may copy a spell out of the book if it is normally on his or her spell list; other characters may only copy rituals that they are able to cast.

## History

A sorcerer learned the wisdom contained in this tome from the storm giants of the highest peaks. The trials shattered his body, and he finished this work on the day that died. The storm giants would grant the *final manuscript* to one who survived their three trials: the Spear-Maiden, whom one must best in combat; the Jester, whom one must best in wit; and the Seventy-Seven Thunders, which one must endure without flinching. One who attains the manuscript might find that the sorcerer's ghost left unfinished business in the world.
