While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as [*cloudkill*](/spells/cloudkill/) and [*stinking cloud*](/spells/stinking-cloud/) effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).
