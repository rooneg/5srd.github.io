While a fire burns in this brass brazier, you can use an action to speak the brazier's command word and summon a fire elemental, as if you had cast the [*conjure elemental*](/spells/conjure-elemental/) spell. The brazier can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The brazier weighs 5 pounds.
