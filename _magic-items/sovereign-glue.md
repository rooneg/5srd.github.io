This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [*oil of slipperiness*](/magic-items/oil-of-slipperiness/). When found, a container contains 1d6+1 ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of [*universal solvent*](/magic-items/universal-solvent/) or [*oil of etherealness*](/magic-items/oil-of-etherealness/), or with a [*wish*](/spells/wish/) spell.
