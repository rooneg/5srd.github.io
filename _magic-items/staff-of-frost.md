You have resistance to cold damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [*cone of cold*](/spells/cone-of-cold/) (5 charges), [*fog cloud*](/spells/fog-cloud/) (1 charge), [*ice storm*](/spells/ice-storm/) (4 charges), or [*wall of ice*](/spells/wall-of-ice/) (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to water and is destroyed.
