You may inscribe up to twenty spell levels of illusion spells into this volume. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against an illusion spell inscribed into this book that you cast, it takes 1d10 psychic damage. This may occur more than once per casting, if the spell allows repeated saving throws.

Additionally, the spell save DC of your illusion spells increases by 1.

A wizard may copy a spell out of the book if it is normally on his or her spell list; other characters may only copy rituals that they are able to cast.

## History

A master illusionist penned this magnum opus during her long exile, only to have it stolen from her. One who returned it to her could expect her gratitude; one who freed her could expect to keep the *green book*, in a yet greater form.
