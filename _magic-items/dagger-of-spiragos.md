The serrated blade of this foul weapon is made of some strange, blackened metal. Its handle is made of sweat- darkened skin, perhaps crafted from human flesh, and the tarnished silver pommel is a stylized, twisting spider.

You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls for attacks you make with this magic weapon; despite being the size of a typical shortsword, it can be wielded without penalty by anyone proficient with either a shortsword or a dagger. If you apply poison to the weapon, that poisonâ€™s saving throw DC increases by 2.

Once per day, you can use a bonus action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until you hit with an attack using this weapon. When you hit a creature with the poisoned weapon, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes poisoned for 1 minute and takes 11 (2d10) poison damage.

The *dagger of Spiragos* can be destroyed only by submerging it in holy water for 33 days and then melting it in the fiery heart's-blood of a thulkan.
