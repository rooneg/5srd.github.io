You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [*burning hands*](/spells/burning-hands/) (1 charge), [*fireball*](/spells/fireball/) (3 charges), or [*wall of fire*](/spells/wall-of-fire/) (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
