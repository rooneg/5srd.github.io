This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: [*cure wounds*](/spells/cure-wounds/) (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), [*lesser restoration*](/spells/restoration-lesser/) (2 charges), or [*mass cure wounds*](/spells/cure-wounds-mass/) (5 charges).

The staff regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.
