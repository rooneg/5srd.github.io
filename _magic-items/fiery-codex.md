When a creature fails its saving throw against a damaging spell you cast, the book gains 1 charge. Whenever you roll damage for a spell you cast, you may spend 1 charge to reroll up to three damage dice. You must use the new results. The *fiery codex* can hold up to 8 charges; the first time in a day that it would gain a ninth charge, roll d100.

On a result of 01--05, the book blackens, turns to ash, and disintegrates over the course of 3 rounds. It reappears elsewhere in the world in 24 hours. On a result of 06--25, the book casts  [*fireball*](/spells/fireball/) as a 3rd-level spell, centered on its attuned bearer. Its spell save DC is 15.

On a result of 26--100, a new spell appears in the book. You must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Religion) check to comprehend the spell. The spell is randomly generated; roll 1d6 for its spell level and roll 1d4 to determine the spell's class list: 1, bard; 2, cleric; 3, warlock; 4, wizard. As long as the book is attuned, you may cast spells added in this way as if they are on your class spell list. The book can hold up to six spells in this way.

A wizard may copy a spell out of the book if it is normally on his or her spell list; other characters may only copy rituals that they are able to cast.

## History

This infernal book was created as a cunning prison for a fiend by a diabolical warlock; the fiend now suffers the indignity of imprisonment.

The warlock made the pages from the parched skins of mortals and the ink from the fiend's blood, binding the devilâ€™s soul into the book. One last vial of the fiend's ichor remains, hidden in his abandoned palace; with it one might write the words to free him, or destroy the codex entirely.
