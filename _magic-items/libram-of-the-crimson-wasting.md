When a creature within 60 feet of you deals damage to you with a spell, you may spend a spell slot as a reaction to infect them with the [crimson wasting](/diseases/crimson-wasting/). The Constitution saving throw DC to resist this disease is equal to 10 + the level of the expended spell slot. A creature that succeeds a saving throw against the crimson wasting is immune to further infections for 24 hours.

Additionally, you may inscribe up to seven necromantic spells of 1st level or higher into the *libram of the crimson wasting*. Your spell attack rolls, spell damage rolls, and saving throw DCs for these spells receive a +2 bonus.

A wizard may copy a spell out of the book if it is normally on his or her spell list; other characters may only copy rituals that they are able to cast.

## History

This book, penned in the blood of three elder vampires, contains high and dire secrets of necromancy. It possesses a nascent will of its own, the confused and thirsting dreams of the three. It was written by a corrupted priestess, who used the *libram of the crimson wasting* to slay an angel and animate it as a vampire. To this day, the vampiric angel haunts the ruins near where it was created, spreading horror and a terrible thirst for blood wherever it goes.
