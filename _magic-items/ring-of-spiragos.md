This black band is shaped like a spider, four of its legs extending around to either side and joining on the opposite side of the wearerâ€™s finger. Its eyes are tiny emeralds.

If you are a [druid](/classes/druid/), then starting at 5th level, you can use your wild shape feature to transform into a [giant spider](/monsters/spider-giant/).

If you are a [druid](/classes/druid/), [sorcerer](/classes/sorcerer/), or [warlock](/classes/warlock/), while you wear this ring, you gain the following:

- **Spells.** You add [*bestow curse*](/spells/bestow-curse/), [*spider climb*](/spells/spider-climb/), and [*web*](/spells/web/) to the list of spells you know or have prepared.
- **Spider Friend.** Three times per day, you can cast the [*charm monster*](/spells/charm-monster/) spell (save DC 13) without using any components. This spell targets only spiders, whether normal or of the giant variety, and monsters that are spider-like in nature.
- **Virulence.** Whenever you cast a spell that deals poison damage or imposes the poisoned condition, the saving throw DC of that spell increases by 1, if applicable.
- **Web Walker.** You ignore movement restrictions caused by webbing.

The *ring of Spiragos* can be destroyed only if sundered by a [solar](/monsters/angel-solar/) or a good-aligned demigod or deity.
